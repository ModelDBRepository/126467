This model of cardiac sarcomere dynamics linked to calcium kinetics is implemented and
modified for Neuron by Francois E. Gannier and Claire O. Malecot 
	from University of Tours - FRANCE
	Physiologie des Cellules Cardiaques et Vasculaires
	email address: francois.gannier@univ-tours.fr

It is based on the paper by :
Negroni JA & Lascano EC (1996) A cardiac muscle model relating sarcomere 
dynamics to calcium kinetics. J Mol Cell Cardio 28:915-929 [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8762031" target='url' >PubMed</a>]

this is a now classic model of contraction which has been added in some recent models 
(eg : kyoto model (2003), Okada model (2005))

it uses a four-state combination to show the relation between C-Troponin, calcium,
cross-bridges and Force.

The orginal model was modified to allow several stimuli with self-chosen frequency.
(This allows to reproduce a staircase phenomenom)
 
To run the simulation auto-launch the model from modeldb or download
and extract the archive and then compile the mod files under:

unix/linux:
-----------
type nrnivmodl in the NegroniLascano folder and then
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin:
------
run mknrndll and then double click on mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X:
--------

Drag and drop the NegroniLascano folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag
and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation starts it recreates a figure similar to Fig. 2 (shown as three 
panels for clarity)& 3 of the original paper.
